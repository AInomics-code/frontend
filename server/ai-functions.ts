**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: ADOBO PARA TODO shows zero movement = complete market rejection, likely quality or taste issue
- Secondary: ANIS ESTRELLA massive decline suggests supply chain disruption or competitor displacement
- External: Potential new competitor products capturing shelf space during our stock-outs
- Internal: Lack of product performance monitoring allowed deterioration to reach critical levels

**IMPACT:** Combined revenue loss exceeds $500 per SKU. Inventory carrying costs bleeding cash. Shelf space being surrendered to competitors. Customer loyalty shifting to alternative brands.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: Discontinue ADOBO PARA TODO production today - stop inventory bleeding
- SHORT-TERM: Emergency audit of ANIS ESTRELLA supply chain and quality control (next 48 hours)
- LONG-TERM: Implement weekly SKU performance alerts to catch declines before they reach -50%

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Track weekly sales recovery for remaining SKUs. Target: Stop negative variance within 2 weeks. Reallocate shelf space to achieve +15% performance on replacement products within 30 days.`;

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Back-order crisis ($39,118.09 outstanding) preventing order fulfillment and revenue recognition
- Secondary: SUPERMERCADOS XTRA chain systematic underperformance (-$54,000 combined variance)
- External: Potential market disruption or competitor aggressive pricing during our supply shortages
- Internal: Production schedule failures (delivered only $564.71 vs expected) cascading into sales collapse

**IMPACT:** Operational liquidity threatened. Cash flow negative. Fixed costs now represent 80%+ of revenue vs normal 40%. Credit rating at risk. Supplier relationships strained.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: Activate emergency credit line and cash flow management protocols (today)
- SHORT-TERM: Focus all sales efforts on PRODUCTOS ALIMENTICIOS SPACIAL model - our only 95.96% performer (next 7 days)
- LONG-TERM: Restructure production schedule and implement daily financial monitoring dashboard (next 30 days)

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Target 50% billing recovery within 14 days ($2.4M minimum). Restore margin to 1.5+ within 30 days. Eliminate back-orders to enable full revenue recognition.`;

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Back-order crisis preventing order fulfillment across XTRA chain (39 locations affected)
- Secondary: Sales execution breakdown - reps unable to service accounts due to inventory shortages
- External: XTRA chain may be shifting volume to competitors with reliable supply
- Internal: Lack of account management protocols during crisis, no escalation procedures activated

**IMPACT:** 86% below target = $680,000+ revenue shortfall. Market share loss to competitors. XTRA partnership at risk ($54,000 negative variance). Sales team morale declining from inability to fulfill orders.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: Deploy emergency account team to XTRA management - prevent account loss (next 24 hours)
- SHORT-TERM: Replicate PRODUCTOS ALIMENTICIOS SPACIAL model across top 5 underperformers (next 7 days)
- LONG-TERM: Implement supply-linked sales targets and daily performance tracking with escalation triggers

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Target 40%+ achievement within 14 days. Recover XTRA variance to -$20,000 maximum. Achieve 3 additional accounts at 90%+ performance within 30 days.`;

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Production schedule failure - delivered only $564.71 vs expected, indicating manufacturing capacity or planning breakdown
- Secondary: Panama Province distribution bottleneck - 62.6% concentration suggests logistics or warehouse issues
- External: Potential supplier raw material shortages affecting KETCHUP and MIEL production lines
- Internal: No early warning system to prevent stockouts from reaching crisis levels

**IMPACT:** $39,118+ in immediate revenue loss. Customer orders unfulfilled, risking permanent account defection. Sales team unable to service 39 client locations. Competitor opportunity to capture market share during our absence.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: Emergency production run for KETCHUP 78 OZ - highest demand SKU (next 12 hours)
- SHORT-TERM: Establish Panama Province emergency supply protocol and expedited logistics (next 48 hours)
- LONG-TERM: Implement daily production monitoring with automatic alerts when inventory drops below 7-day demand

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Clear 50% of back-orders within 72 hours. Restore KETCHUP inventory to 30-day supply within 1 week. Reduce Panama Province concentration to <40% of total back-orders.`;

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Back-order crisis preventing order fulfillment across all XTRA locations - systematic supply failure
- Secondary: Relationship management breakdown - no proactive communication during crisis period
- External: XTRA may be testing alternative suppliers due to our unreliability
- Internal: Account management protocols failed to escalate critical client issues to executive level

**IMPACT:** Combined -$54,000 variance threatens partnership termination. Loss of XTRA would remove major distribution channel. Reputation damage affecting other chain negotiations. Sales team credibility destroyed with key account.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: Executive meeting with XTRA chain management within 24 hours - CEO level intervention required
- SHORT-TERM: Deploy dedicated account manager with daily communication protocols (next 7 days)
- LONG-TERM: Implement VIP client early warning system and guaranteed supply commitments for top 3 chains

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Recover XTRA performance to 60%+ within 30 days. Reduce variance to -$15,000 maximum. Secure written commitment for continued partnership despite current issues.`;

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Back-order crisis ($39,118.09) creating cascade failure across sales, billing, and client relationships
- Secondary: Production system breakdown (delivered only $564.71 vs expected) preventing revenue recognition
- External: Competitors likely capturing market share during our supply failures
- Internal: Management systems failed to prevent or escalate issues before reaching crisis levels

**IMPACT:** Multiple systems failing simultaneously threatens business sustainability. Revenue compression from $6.3M to $1.2M. Fixed costs overwhelming reduced revenue. Market position deteriorating. Key partnerships at risk.

- IMMEDIATE: Activate crisis management protocols - CEO intervention required (next 24 hours)
- SHORT-TERM: Focus all resources on PRODUCTOS ALIMENTICIOS SPACIAL model replication (next 7 days)
- LONG-TERM: Implement integrated early warning dashboard connecting production, sales, and client performance

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Target 50% recovery across all metrics within 30 days. Billing recovery to $3M minimum. Sales achievement to 40%+. Eliminate critical back-orders completely.`;
