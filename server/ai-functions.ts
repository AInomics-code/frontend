- <span class="key-point">Condimento Básico</span> - Sales trend: -18%, Margin: 8%, Slow movement pattern

**Secondary Candidates (Review Required):**
- <span class="key-point">Adobo Tradicional</span> - Declining 15% but reformulation potential exists
- <span class="metric-highlight">Salsa Verde 200ml</span> - Low margin (12%) with seasonal dependency

**Financial Impact Analysis:**

- Free up <span class="performance-positive">$8,400 in working capital</span> from excess inventory
- Reduce storage costs by <span class="key-point">15% monthly</span>

  Performance: 72% target achievement = 0.86 efficiency ratio

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Xtra and El Machetazo overspending stems from excessive promotional investments without corresponding sales results. Poor execution and market positioning drive low efficiency ratios.

**Corrective Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Freeze additional Xtra and El Machetazo spending until performance improves
2. **Reallocate:** Transfer $5,000 from underperforming chains to Super99 for expansion
3. **Performance Gates:** Implement monthly efficiency reviews before budget releases

**Why This Is Happening:**
${lowStockProduct ? `The main problem is inventory management. Take ${lowStockProduct.name} - we're sitting at only ${lowStockProduct.currentStock} units when we should have ${lowStockProduct.targetStock}. This creates stockouts that push customers to competitors.` : 'Our supply chain timing is off-sync with demand patterns, causing missed sales opportunities.'}

Looking at the data, ${poorProduct?.name || 'our underperforming SKUs'} likely suffered from either formula issues, pricing pressure, or distribution gaps. The market is telling us something - we need to listen.

**Why This Matters:**
Every day we're understocked on ${lowStockProduct?.name || 'key products'}, we're handing <span class="performance-positive">$${(lowStockProduct?.sellingPrice * lowStockProduct?.targetStock * 0.023 || 45).toFixed(0)} daily</span> to our competition. That adds up to <span class="metric-highlight">$${(lowStockProduct?.sellingPrice * lowStockProduct?.targetStock * 0.7 || 1350).toFixed(0)} monthly</span> in lost revenue.

Our high-margin products like ${topMarginProducts[0]?.name} are sitting at only ${topMarginProducts[0]?.currentStock} units - we could be making <span class="performance-positive">$${(topMarginProducts[0]?.sellingPrice * topMarginProducts[0]?.margin * 0.01 * 100).toFixed(0)} more per unit sold</span> if we push these harder.

**What We Need to Do:**
1. **Today:** Call our supplier and get ${lowStockProduct?.targetStock || 200} units of ${lowStockProduct?.name || 'priority SKUs'} shipped this week
2. **This Week:** Launch a promotion on ${topMarginProducts[0]?.name} - it's our highest margin at ${topMarginProducts[0]?.margin}% and customers love it
3. **This Month:** Meet with the team to reformulate ${poorProduct?.name || 'underperforming products'} or consider discontinuing
4. **Next Quarter:** Expand ${topMarginProducts[1]?.name} distribution to capture more premium market share

The bottom line: we can recover <span class="performance-positive">$${(poorProducts.slice(0,3).reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.sellingPrice * p.targetStock * 0.4), 0) || 850).toFixed(0)} monthly</span> by fixing these issues. That's real money back in our pocket.`;

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The biggest concern is ${biggestDebtor?.name || 'our largest client'} - they owe <span class="metric-highlight">$${biggestDebtor?.overdueAmount.toLocaleString() || '24,300'}</span> and it's been outstanding for <span class="key-point">${biggestDebtor?.overdueDays || 135} days</span>.

**Business Impact:**

**Recommended Action Plan:**
1. **Immediate:** Contact ${biggestDebtor?.name || 'largest debtor'} regarding $${biggestDebtor?.overdueAmount.toLocaleString() || '24,300'} outstanding balance
2. **Week 1:** Implement 2/10 net 30 payment terms with early payment discounts and late penalties

3. <span class="metric-highlight">${regionalData[2]?.name}: ${regionalData[2]?.avgPerformance.toFixed(1)}% (improvement opportunity)</span>

**Market Penetration Analysis:**
Top region drivers:
- <span class="performance-positive">${regionalData[0].name}: ${regionalData[0].clients.length} active clients, $${regionalData[0].clients.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.monthlyVolume, 0).toLocaleString()} monthly volume</span>
- <span class="key-point">Success factors: ${regionalData[0].reps.length} rep coverage, ${regionalData[0].keyClients.length} strategic accounts</span>

**Geographic Revenue Distribution:**
- <span class="metric-highlight">Concentration risk: ${((regionalData[0].clients.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.monthlyVolume, 0) / extendedClients.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.monthlyVolume, 0)) * 100).toFixed(1)}%</span> revenue from top region
- <span class="performance-positive">Expansion opportunity: ${regionalData[2]?.clients.filter(c => c.monthlyVolume < 20000).length} underdeveloped accounts</span>
- <span class="key-point">Market coverage: ${Math.round((extendedClients.filter(c => c.isActive).length / extendedClients.length) * 100)}% active penetration</span>

**Strategic Regional Actions:**
→ Immediate: Replicate ${regionalData[0].name} model in ${regionalData[2]?.name}
→ Week 1: Increase ${regionalData[2]?.name} rep coverage from ${regionalData[2]?.reps.length} to ${regionalData[0].reps.length}
→ Month 1: Launch ${regionalData[2]?.clients.filter(c => c.monthlyVolume > 15000).length} account development program
→ Quarter: Achieve balanced 40/35/25 regional revenue distribution`;

  // Default comprehensive business overview
  return `Here's the comprehensive business intelligence overview based on current La Doña operations data.

**Current Business Position:**
Our revenue pipeline is sitting at <span class="metric-highlight">$${totalRevenue.toLocaleString()}</span> from ${salesData.length} transactions. Our star product is <span class="performance-positive">${topMarginProducts[0]?.name}</span> with a beautiful ${topMarginProducts[0]?.margin}% margin, and ${topPerformer.name} is leading the sales charge at <span class="performance-positive">${topPerformer.performance}% of target</span>.

**Critical Issues Identified:**
Current operations show <span class="metric-highlight">${outOfStockCount} products out of stock</span>, representing immediate revenue loss. Additionally, <span class="key-point">$${totalOverdue.toLocaleString()} in overdue receivables</span> ties up working capital. However, promotional campaigns demonstrate strong performance with <span class="performance-positive">${avgPromotionROI.toFixed(1)}% average ROI</span>.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Inventory stockouts result from supply chain timing misalignment with demand patterns, causing customer defection to competitors. Extended receivables indicate insufficient collection procedures or overly lenient credit terms. Promotional success validates effective marketing execution when properly resourced.

**Business Impact Assessment:**
Daily inventory shortages compound revenue losses through customer acquisition by competitors. Receivables delays prevent capital deployment for growth initiatives. The company maintains ${extendedClients.filter(c => !c.isActive).length} inactive accounts representing reactivation opportunities.

**Strategic Action Framework:**
1. **Immediate:** ${lowStockProducts[0]?.name ? `Restock ${lowStockProducts[0].name} (current: ${lowStockProducts[0].currentStock} units vs target: ${lowStockProducts[0].targetStock})` : 'Address critical inventory shortages through expedited procurement'}
2. **Week 1:** Initiate collection procedures for ${overdueClients[0]?.name || 'primary debtors'} regarding $${overdueClients[0]?.overdueAmount.toLocaleString() || '24,300'} outstanding balance
3. **Month 1:** Implement ${topPerformer.name} training methodology across sales team for potential <span class="performance-positive">$${((topPerformer.performance - 45) * salesReps.length * 1000).toFixed(0)} monthly revenue increase</span>

**Financial Recovery Potential:**
Product mix optimization could yield <span class="performance-positive">$${(topMarginProducts.slice(0,3).reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.sellingPrice * p.targetStock * 0.3), 0)).toFixed(0)} monthly additional revenue</span>. Accelerated collections target <span class="key-point">$${(totalOverdue * 0.7).toFixed(0)} recovery</span>. Dormant account reactivation provides supplementary growth opportunities through existing relationship leverage.`;
