**What We're Seeing:**
We've got <span class="metric-highlight">${poorProducts.length} products with declining sales</span> - that's concerning. The worst performer, ${poorProduct?.name || 'Mayonesa 400g'}, is down <span class="key-point">${Math.abs(poorProduct?.salesTrend || 15)}%</span> from last period. Meanwhile, our best margin makers are <span class="performance-positive">${topMarginProducts[0]?.name} at ${topMarginProducts[0]?.margin}%</span> and <span class="performance-positive">${topMarginProducts[1]?.name} at ${topMarginProducts[1]?.margin}%</span> - these are our golden geese.

**Why This Is Happening:**
${lowStockProduct ? `The main problem is inventory management. Take ${lowStockProduct.name} - we're sitting at only ${lowStockProduct.currentStock} units when we should have ${lowStockProduct.targetStock}. This creates stockouts that push customers to competitors.` : 'Our supply chain timing is off-sync with demand patterns, causing missed sales opportunities.'}

Looking at the data, ${poorProduct?.name || 'our underperforming SKUs'} likely suffered from either formula issues, pricing pressure, or distribution gaps. The market is telling us something - we need to listen.

**Why This Matters:**
Every day we're understocked on ${lowStockProduct?.name || 'key products'}, we're handing <span class="performance-positive">$${(lowStockProduct?.sellingPrice * lowStockProduct?.targetStock * 0.023 || 45).toFixed(0)} daily</span> to our competition. That adds up to <span class="metric-highlight">$${(lowStockProduct?.sellingPrice * lowStockProduct?.targetStock * 0.7 || 1350).toFixed(0)} monthly</span> in lost revenue.

Our high-margin products like ${topMarginProducts[0]?.name} are sitting at only ${topMarginProducts[0]?.currentStock} units - we could be making <span class="performance-positive">$${(topMarginProducts[0]?.sellingPrice * topMarginProducts[0]?.margin * 0.01 * 100).toFixed(0)} more per unit sold</span> if we push these harder.

**What We Need to Do:**
1. **Today:** Call our supplier and get ${lowStockProduct?.targetStock || 200} units of ${lowStockProduct?.name || 'priority SKUs'} shipped this week
2. **This Week:** Launch a promotion on ${topMarginProducts[0]?.name} - it's our highest margin at ${topMarginProducts[0]?.margin}% and customers love it
3. **This Month:** Meet with the team to reformulate ${poorProduct?.name || 'underperforming products'} or consider discontinuing
4. **Next Quarter:** Expand ${topMarginProducts[1]?.name} distribution to capture more premium market share

The bottom line: we can recover <span class="performance-positive">$${(poorProducts.slice(0,3).reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.sellingPrice * p.targetStock * 0.4), 0) || 850).toFixed(0)} monthly</span> by fixing these issues. That's real money back in our pocket.`;

**Current Financial Position:**
Today we billed <span class="metric-highlight">$${totalBilling.toLocaleString()}</span> across ${todayInvoices.length} invoices, which gives us an average order of <span class="performance-positive">$${avgOrderValue.toFixed(2)}</span>. That's actually not bad - shows our customers are buying decent volumes.

But here's the problem: we've got <span class="key-point">$${pendingInvoices.reduce((sum, inv) => sum + inv.amount, 0).toLocaleString()} still pending collection</span> from just today's sales, and much worse - we're carrying <span class="metric-highlight">$${overdueValue.toLocaleString()} in overdue receivables</span> across ${overdueClients.length} accounts.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The biggest concern is ${biggestDebtor?.name || 'our largest client'} - they owe <span class="metric-highlight">$${biggestDebtor?.overdueAmount.toLocaleString() || '24,300'}</span> and it's been outstanding for <span class="key-point">${biggestDebtor?.overdueDays || 135} days</span>. That's nearly 5 months overdue.

The data shows our average collection period is <span class="metric-highlight">${Math.round(overdueClients.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.overdueDays, 0) / overdueClients.length)} days</span> when industry standard is 30 days maximum. This indicates either inadequate credit policies or insufficient collection follow-up procedures.

**Business Impact:**
Working capital of <span class="performance-positive">$${overdueValue.toLocaleString()}</span> is tied up in receivables instead of generating returns through inventory investment or growth initiatives.

Current billing trends project <span class="performance-positive">$${(totalBilling * 25).toLocaleString()} monthly revenue</span>, but collecting 85% of overdue amounts would provide <span class="performance-positive">$${(overdueValue * 0.85).toFixed(0)} immediate cash injection</span>.

**Recommended Action Plan:**
1. **Immediate:** Contact ${biggestDebtor?.name || 'largest debtor'} regarding $${biggestDebtor?.overdueAmount.toLocaleString() || '24,300'} outstanding balance
2. **Week 1:** Implement 2/10 net 30 payment terms with early payment discounts and late penalties
3. **Month 1:** Reinvest $${(overdueValue * 0.4).toFixed(0)} of collected funds into high-velocity inventory
4. **Target:** Achieve 15-day average collection period, freeing <span class="key-point">$${(overdueValue * 0.6).toFixed(0)} for strategic investments</span>

Successful collection optimization could drive quarterly revenue to <span class="performance-positive">$${(totalBilling * 75).toLocaleString()}</span> with significantly improved cash flow management.`;

4. **90-Day Goal:** Achieve 65%+ performance across all territories through proven methodology adoption

  // Default comprehensive business overview
  return `Here's the comprehensive business intelligence overview based on current La DoÃ±a operations data.

**Current Business Position:**
Our revenue pipeline is sitting at <span class="metric-highlight">$${totalRevenue.toLocaleString()}</span> from ${salesData.length} transactions. Our star product is <span class="performance-positive">${topMarginProducts[0]?.name}</span> with a beautiful ${topMarginProducts[0]?.margin}% margin, and ${topPerformer.name} is leading the sales charge at <span class="performance-positive">${topPerformer.performance}% of target</span>.

**Critical Issues Identified:**
Current operations show <span class="metric-highlight">${outOfStockCount} products out of stock</span>, representing immediate revenue loss. Additionally, <span class="key-point">$${totalOverdue.toLocaleString()} in overdue receivables</span> ties up working capital. However, promotional campaigns demonstrate strong performance with <span class="performance-positive">${avgPromotionROI.toFixed(1)}% average ROI</span>.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Inventory stockouts result from supply chain timing misalignment with demand patterns, causing customer defection to competitors. Extended receivables indicate insufficient collection procedures or overly lenient credit terms. Promotional success validates effective marketing execution when properly resourced.

**Business Impact Assessment:**
Daily inventory shortages compound revenue losses through customer acquisition by competitors. Receivables delays prevent capital deployment for growth initiatives. The company maintains ${extendedClients.filter(c => !c.isActive).length} inactive accounts representing reactivation opportunities.

**Strategic Action Framework:**
1. **Immediate:** ${lowStockProducts[0]?.name ? `Restock ${lowStockProducts[0].name} (current: ${lowStockProducts[0].currentStock} units vs target: ${lowStockProducts[0].targetStock})` : 'Address critical inventory shortages through expedited procurement'}
2. **Week 1:** Initiate collection procedures for ${overdueClients[0]?.name || 'primary debtors'} regarding $${overdueClients[0]?.overdueAmount.toLocaleString() || '24,300'} outstanding balance
3. **Month 1:** Implement ${topPerformer.name} training methodology across sales team for potential <span class="performance-positive">$${((topPerformer.performance - 45) * salesReps.length * 1000).toFixed(0)} monthly revenue increase</span>

**Financial Recovery Potential:**
Product mix optimization could yield <span class="performance-positive">$${(topMarginProducts.slice(0,3).reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.sellingPrice * p.targetStock * 0.3), 0)).toFixed(0)} monthly additional revenue</span>. Accelerated collections target <span class="key-point">$${(totalOverdue * 0.7).toFixed(0)} recovery</span>. Dormant account reactivation provides supplementary growth opportunities through existing relationship leverage.`;
