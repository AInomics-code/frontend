**Root Causes**
- <span class="key-point">Anís Estrella supplier (Especias del Caribe) discontinued preferred grade</span> without notice
- <span class="performance-negative">Adobo contains 23% salt vs competitor 18%</span>
- Garlic powder hit by <span class="performance-negative">McCormick's 25% promotional campaign</span>

**Recovery Actions**
- Week 1: Source from <span class="key-point">Condimentos Tropicales (+12% cost)</span>, reformulate Adobo to 18% salt
- Month 1: Test reformulated Adobo in <span class="performance-positive">top 5 Xtra locations</span>
- Target: <span class="performance-positive">$65+ monthly for Anís Estrella within 60 days</span>

**Recommended Next Steps**
→ Check supplier contracts and backup options
→ Review customer feedback on reformulated products
→ Analyze competitor pricing strategies
→ Evaluate production capacity for ketchup expansion`;

    return `**Sales Performance Intelligence Report**
Current sales achievement of 13.40% versus budget target 791,151.26 represents a severe 86.6% underperformance that puts us in the bottom 5% of Central American food manufacturers. This translates to $680,734 in lost monthly revenue potential. The Supermercados Xtra chain crisis shows systematic account management breakdown: Bugaba location at 17.87% (-$19,922 variance), David branch at 24.29% (-$28,101 variance), and M.F. David at 24.40% (-$6,514 variance). However, Spacial Foods achieves 95.96% performance, proving our operational capabilities when properly executed.

**Sales Ecosystem Analysis**
- Account concentration risk: Xtra chain represents 67% of our retail volume but contributes 89% of current variance problems, creating dangerous dependency
- Sales rep efficiency: Average calls per day dropped from 8.2 to 3.1 due to back-order explanations consuming 73% of customer interaction time
- Product mix impact: High-margin ketchup sales down 78% while low-margin commodity products maintained 45% of volume, crushing profitability
- Territory dynamics: Panama City territory generates 42% of total sales but suffers 67% of back-order issues due to distribution bottlenecks

**Competitive Landscape Intelligence**
- Market share erosion: Lost 23% share in ketchup category to Heinz during our supply crisis, with retailers offering permanent shelf space to competitors
- Pricing pressure: Maggi launched 15% promotional pricing across seasonings, forcing us to match while operating at negative margins
- Customer switching data: Exit interviews show 34% of lost customers cite "unreliable supply" as primary reason, with 67% indicating they won't return even after resolution
- Channel dynamics: Traditional retail down 45% while modern trade declined only 28%, suggesting stronger relationships in organized retail

**Root Cause Sales Forensics**
- Primary driver: Back-order crisis eliminated sales team credibility - 78% of customer meetings now focus on apologies rather than growth opportunities
- Execution breakdown: Territory realignment in Q1 disrupted 15 key customer relationships, with new reps requiring 3-month learning curve during our worst performance period
- Inventory allocation: Automated system prioritizes large orders, leaving small/medium customers (65% of account base) with chronic shortages
- Commission structure misalignment: Current system rewards volume over profitability, incentivizing low-margin deals that hurt overall performance

**Strategic Sales Recovery Architecture**
- Week 1-2: Deploy "Account Rescue Protocol" - assign senior management to personally visit all Xtra locations. Implement emergency inventory allocation giving each location guaranteed minimum stock levels.
- Month 1: Launch "Customer Win-Back Campaign" targeting the 34 lost accounts with personalized service recovery plans. Restructure territory assignments based on relationship strength rather than geography.
- Quarter 3: Install predictive inventory system preventing stock-outs for A and B customers. Revise commission structure to reward margin dollars rather than volume units.

**Performance Recovery Trajectory**
Week 2: Achieve 25% sales performance through emergency inventory allocation and management intervention. Month 1: Reach 40% through systematic account recovery and improved product availability. Quarter end: Target 72% performance through structural improvements and market share recapture. Specific account goals: Xtra variance improvement to -$15,000 by month-end, addition of 5 new B-level accounts generating $45,000 monthly, and restoration of ketchup category leadership through focused promotional support.`;

  // Back-order queries
  if (lowerQuestion.includes('back') || lowerQuestion.includes('order') || lowerQuestion.includes('stock')) {
    return `**SITUATION:** Critical back-order crisis with $39,118.09 outstanding (NEGATIVE - should maintain <$10K max). KETCHUP 78 OZ completely out of stock (15 units needed vs normal 200+ inventory). MIEL DE ABEJA 325 GRS zero stock (9 units needed vs standard 50+ units). Panama Province represents 62.6% of back-orders (NEGATIVE - should be <25% regional concentration).

**COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:**
- Current State: Back-orders 400% above acceptable threshold with critical SKUs completely depleted
- How We Got Here: Production delivered only $564.71 vs expected $400K+ weekly output. Panama Province logistics bottleneck created 62.6% regional concentration. No early warning triggered as inventory declined to zero.
- What It Should Be: Food manufacturers maintain <$10K back-orders (2% of monthly volume). KETCHUP/MIEL should never reach zero stock given high demand patterns. Regional distribution should spread risk <25% per province.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Production schedule collapse - delivered 99% below expected capacity indicating system failure
- Secondary: Inventory management system failure - no alerts triggered before complete stockouts
- External: Potential raw material supply disruption affecting core product lines
- Internal: No escalation protocols when production falls below critical minimums

**IMPACT:** $39,118+ immediate revenue loss with customer orders unfulfilled. 39 client locations without product access. Competitor opportunity during our market absence. Customer loyalty permanently at risk.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: Emergency production allocation for KETCHUP 78 OZ - highest demand SKU (next 12 hours)
- SHORT-TERM: Implement Panama Province expedited logistics and regional inventory balancing (next 48 hours)
- LONG-TERM: Install automated inventory alerts at 14-day, 7-day, and 3-day supply levels with escalation protocols

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Clear 60% of back-orders within 72 hours. Restore KETCHUP inventory to 45-day supply within 1 week. Reduce regional concentration to <30% maximum.`;

**COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:**
- Current State: Three major XTRA locations performing at 17-24% vs industry standard 75%+ for established chain partnerships
- How We Got Here: Back-order crisis prevented fulfillment across all XTRA locations. Relationship management breakdown with no proactive crisis communication. Account management failed to escalate critical issues to executive intervention level.
- What It Should Be: Healthy chain partnerships maintain 75-85% achievement consistently. XTRA locations should average 80%+ given their established customer base. Variance should never exceed -$10K per location monthly.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Systematic supply failure creating fulfillment impossibility across entire chain network
- Secondary: Account management protocol breakdown - no crisis escalation or executive intervention triggered
- External: XTRA management likely evaluating alternative suppliers given our unreliable performance
- Internal: No VIP client protection protocols during operational crises

**IMPACT:** Combined -$54,537.70 variance threatens immediate partnership termination. Loss of XTRA removes major distribution channel (39 locations). Reputation damage affecting negotiations with other chains. Sales team credibility permanently damaged.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: CEO-level emergency meeting with XTRA executive team within 24 hours - prevent contract cancellation
- SHORT-TERM: Deploy dedicated XTRA account manager with daily performance reporting and communication protocols (next 7 days)
- LONG-TERM: Establish VIP client protection system with guaranteed supply commitments and executive escalation triggers for top 3 chains

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Recover XTRA average performance to 65%+ within 30 days. Reduce combined variance to -$20,000 maximum. Secure written partnership extension despite current crisis.`;
