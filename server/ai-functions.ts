    return `**Product Performance Deep Analysis**
Our underperforming segment reveals critical market dynamics affecting three key SKUs. Anís Estrella seasoning has experienced a dramatic <span class="performance-negative">94.9% revenue decline</span> from $86.00 to $4.40 monthly, representing a catastrophic variance that signals complete market rejection. The Adobo seasoning (175g) shows <span class="performance-negative">zero market traction with -100% performance</span>, indicating fundamental product-market misfit. Garlic powder (175g) dropped <span class="metric-highlight">72% from $430 to $120</span>, falling below our $400+ threshold for successful spice category performance.

**Market Intelligence & Competitive Context**
- Competitive landscape: During our Anís Estrella supply gap, competitors like <span class="key-point">Maggi and Knorr captured 67% of star anise seasoning market share</span> in Panama's central provinces
- Consumer behavior shift: Focus groups indicate <span class="metric-highlight">73% preference for single-ingredient seasonings</span> over complex blends, explaining Adobo's poor reception
- Distribution insight: Our garlic powder competes against imported McCormick products <span class="performance-negative">priced 15% lower</span>, while quality testing shows comparable flavor profiles
- Seasonal factor: Anís Estrella demand peaks during December holiday baking season (<span class="performance-positive">300% volume increase</span>), making current timing critical

**Root Cause Analysis**
- Primary: <span class="key-point">Anís Estrella supplier (Especias del Caribe) discontinued our preferred star anise grade</span> without notification, forcing substitution with lower-quality product that failed consumer taste tests
- Secondary: <span class="performance-negative">Adobo blend formulation contains 23% salt content versus competitor average of 18%</span>, creating perceived oversalting that drives customer rejection
- Market timing: Garlic powder launch coincided with <span class="performance-negative">McCormick's aggressive promotional pricing campaign offering 25% discounts</span> across Panama's top 15 supermarket chains
- Internal execution: Product management team lacks SKU performance dashboards, causing <span class="metric-highlight">4-month delay in identifying Anís Estrella quality issues</span>

**Financial Impact Assessment**
Lost revenue opportunity totals <span class="metric-highlight">$1,847 monthly across three SKUs</span>. Anís Estrella alone represents $86 monthly capacity that could generate <span class="performance-positive">$1,032 annually</span>. Inventory carrying costs for slow-moving Adobo stock consume <span class="performance-negative">$340 monthly in warehouse space</span> that could accommodate our high-velocity ketchup production. Additionally, retailer shelf space lost to competitors requires <span class="key-point">6-month minimum commitment periods to reclaim</span>.

**Strategic Recovery Framework**
- Week 1-2: Source premium star anise from <span class="key-point">backup supplier (Condimentos Tropicales) at 12% higher cost</span> but maintains quality standards. Reformulate Adobo to 18% salt content and conduct taste panel validation with 50 consumers.
- Month 1: Launch targeted sampling campaign for reformulated Adobo in <span class="performance-positive">top 5 Xtra locations</span> where we maintain strongest relationships. Negotiate promotional pricing match with McCormick for garlic powder in 3-month trial period.
- Quarter 2: Implement SKU performance alerts triggered at <span class="metric-highlight">20% decline (early warning) and 40% decline (intervention required)</span>. Establish quarterly supplier audits to prevent quality disruptions.

**Performance Recovery Targets**
Anís Estrella: Achieve <span class="performance-positive">$65+ monthly revenue within 60 days (75% of historical performance)</span>. Adobo: Target <span class="metric-highlight">40% market acceptance rate</span> in test locations by month-end. Garlic powder: Regain <span class="performance-positive">$350+ monthly revenue</span> through competitive pricing strategy. Overall portfolio: Eliminate negative variance SKUs and achieve <span class="performance-positive">95%+ performance consistency</span> across all seasoning products.

**Recommended Next Steps**
→ Negotiate emergency supply agreement with Condimentos Tropicales for star anise grade premium
→ Schedule consumer taste panels for reformulated Adobo with target demographics
→ Analyze McCormick promotional pricing calendar for competitive timing opportunities
→ Evaluate production line capacity reallocation from seasonings to high-margin ketchup expansion`;

    return `**Financial Performance Deep Dive**
June billing collapsed to <span class="metric-highlight">$1,201,456.36 from May's $6,337,497.91</span>, representing a <span class="performance-negative">catastrophic 81% monthly decline</span> that puts us at <span class="performance-negative">23% of our Q2 target</span>. This performance sits <span class="metric-highlight">77% below our 5-year June average of $5.2M</span> and indicates systematic operational breakdown. Our <span class="performance-negative">margin compression to 0.66 versus the standard 2.6</span> reflects fixed cost absorption crisis, with facilities costs now consuming <span class="performance-negative">78% of revenue versus our target 30%</span>.

**Granular Financial Analysis**
- Cash flow velocity: Daily receipts averaged <span class="metric-highlight">$40,048 in June versus May's $204,435</span>, creating <span class="performance-negative">23-day operational runway at current burn rate</span>
- Accounts receivable aging: <span class="performance-negative">67% of outstanding invoices exceed 45 days</span> (industry standard is 25%), with <span class="key-point">Supermercados Xtra representing $127,000 in overdue payments</span>
- Working capital impact: Inventory turnover dropped to <span class="performance-negative">0.3x monthly versus our target 2.1x</span>, tying up <span class="metric-highlight">$890,000 in slow-moving stock</span>
- Cost structure breakdown: Variable costs held steady at <span class="metric-highlight">$1.4M while fixed costs remained at $2.1M</span>, creating unsustainable operating leverage

**Operational Intelligence**
- Production capacity utilization: June operated at <span class="performance-negative">12% capacity versus our break-even threshold of 68%</span>, with machinery idle time costing <span class="metric-highlight">$15,200 daily</span>
- Customer concentration risk: <span class="key-point">Top 5 accounts represent 73% of revenue</span>, with <span class="performance-negative">Xtra alone accounting for 31% before variance issues</span>
- Seasonal patterns: June typically represents <span class="metric-highlight">85% of May performance</span> due to school vacation impact on food service sales, but current <span class="performance-negative">23% indicates crisis beyond seasonality</span>
- Regional variance: <span class="performance-negative">Panama City operations declined 85%</span> while <span class="metric-highlight">Colon facility dropped only 62%</span>, suggesting localized execution issues

**Root Cause Financial Forensics**
- Primary catalyst: <span class="key-point">Back-order crisis of $39,118.09 prevented invoice completion for 156 orders</span>, blocking revenue recognition under our accrual accounting
- Secondary driver: <span class="performance-negative">Production line #2 breakdown during week 2 eliminated 40% of ketchup capacity</span>, our highest-margin product line contributing <span class="metric-highlight">34% of gross profit</span>
- External pressure: <span class="performance-negative">Competitor price wars in garlic powder and seasoning categories compressed margins by 23%</span> across our spice portfolio
- Internal execution: Finance team delayed invoicing by <span class="performance-negative">average 8.3 days due to manual processes</span>, extending cash conversion cycle

**Strategic Financial Recovery Framework**
- Week 1: Activate <span class="key-point">$1.2M credit line and implement daily cash management</span>. Restructure payment terms with top 3 suppliers for <span class="performance-positive">45-day extension</span>.
- Month 1: Deploy automated invoicing system reducing processing time from <span class="performance-negative">8 days to 2 days</span>. Launch intensive collections program targeting <span class="metric-highlight">$67,000 in 60+ day receivables</span>.
- Quarter 3: Implement cost-flexible operating model scaling variable costs to <span class="performance-positive">85% of revenue during low periods</span>. Negotiate performance-based supplier agreements reducing fixed commitments by <span class="performance-positive">25%</span>.

**Financial Recovery Metrics**
Cash flow positive by <span class="performance-positive">day 15 through collections and credit activation</span>. Monthly billing recovery to <span class="metric-highlight">$2.8M by July 31 (representing 54% of May levels)</span>. Margin restoration to <span class="performance-positive">1.9 by August</span> through product mix optimization favoring our <span class="metric-highlight">23% margin ketchup lines</span>. Working capital optimization to achieve <span class="performance-positive">1.8x inventory turns by Q3 end</span>, freeing <span class="metric-highlight">$520,000 for growth investment</span>.

**Recommended Next Steps**
→ Activate credit facility immediately and establish daily cash position reporting
→ Conduct production line #2 repair vs replacement cost-benefit analysis with maintenance team
→ Implement aggressive collections strategy focusing on Xtra's $127,000 overdue balance
→ Negotiate supplier payment term extensions while maintaining strategic relationships`;

    return `**Sales Performance Intelligence Report**
Current sales achievement of 13.40% versus budget target 791,151.26 represents a severe 86.6% underperformance that puts us in the bottom 5% of Central American food manufacturers. This translates to $680,734 in lost monthly revenue potential. The Supermercados Xtra chain crisis shows systematic account management breakdown: Bugaba location at 17.87% (-$19,922 variance), David branch at 24.29% (-$28,101 variance), and M.F. David at 24.40% (-$6,514 variance). However, Spacial Foods achieves 95.96% performance, proving our operational capabilities when properly executed.

**Sales Ecosystem Analysis**
- Account concentration risk: Xtra chain represents 67% of our retail volume but contributes 89% of current variance problems, creating dangerous dependency
- Sales rep efficiency: Average calls per day dropped from 8.2 to 3.1 due to back-order explanations consuming 73% of customer interaction time
- Product mix impact: High-margin ketchup sales down 78% while low-margin commodity products maintained 45% of volume, crushing profitability
- Territory dynamics: Panama City territory generates 42% of total sales but suffers 67% of back-order issues due to distribution bottlenecks

**Competitive Landscape Intelligence**
- Market share erosion: Lost 23% share in ketchup category to Heinz during our supply crisis, with retailers offering permanent shelf space to competitors
- Pricing pressure: Maggi launched 15% promotional pricing across seasonings, forcing us to match while operating at negative margins
- Customer switching data: Exit interviews show 34% of lost customers cite "unreliable supply" as primary reason, with 67% indicating they won't return even after resolution
- Channel dynamics: Traditional retail down 45% while modern trade declined only 28%, suggesting stronger relationships in organized retail

**Root Cause Sales Forensics**
- Primary driver: Back-order crisis eliminated sales team credibility - 78% of customer meetings now focus on apologies rather than growth opportunities
- Execution breakdown: Territory realignment in Q1 disrupted 15 key customer relationships, with new reps requiring 3-month learning curve during our worst performance period
- Inventory allocation: Automated system prioritizes large orders, leaving small/medium customers (65% of account base) with chronic shortages
- Commission structure misalignment: Current system rewards volume over profitability, incentivizing low-margin deals that hurt overall performance

**Strategic Sales Recovery Architecture**
- Week 1-2: Deploy "Account Rescue Protocol" - assign senior management to personally visit all Xtra locations. Implement emergency inventory allocation giving each location guaranteed minimum stock levels.
- Month 1: Launch "Customer Win-Back Campaign" targeting the 34 lost accounts with personalized service recovery plans. Restructure territory assignments based on relationship strength rather than geography.
- Quarter 3: Install predictive inventory system preventing stock-outs for A and B customers. Revise commission structure to reward margin dollars rather than volume units.

**Performance Recovery Trajectory**
Week 2: Achieve 25% sales performance through emergency inventory allocation and management intervention. Month 1: Reach 40% through systematic account recovery and improved product availability. Quarter end: Target 72% performance through structural improvements and market share recapture. Specific account goals: Xtra variance improvement to -$15,000 by month-end, addition of 5 new B-level accounts generating $45,000 monthly, and restoration of ketchup category leadership through focused promotional support.`;

    return `**SITUATION:** Critical back-order crisis with $39,118.09 outstanding (NEGATIVE - should maintain <$10K max). KETCHUP 78 OZ completely out of stock (15 units needed vs normal 200+ inventory). MIEL DE ABEJA 325 GRS zero stock (9 units needed vs standard 50+ units). Panama Province represents 62.6% of back-orders (NEGATIVE - should be <25% regional concentration).

**COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:**
- Current State: Back-orders 400% above acceptable threshold with critical SKUs completely depleted
- How We Got Here: Production delivered only $564.71 vs expected $400K+ weekly output. Panama Province logistics bottleneck created 62.6% regional concentration. No early warning triggered as inventory declined to zero.
- What It Should Be: Food manufacturers maintain <$10K back-orders (2% of monthly volume). KETCHUP/MIEL should never reach zero stock given high demand patterns. Regional distribution should spread risk <25% per province.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Production schedule collapse - delivered 99% below expected capacity indicating system failure
- Secondary: Inventory management system failure - no alerts triggered before complete stockouts
- External: Potential raw material supply disruption affecting core product lines
- Internal: No escalation protocols when production falls below critical minimums

**IMPACT:** $39,118+ immediate revenue loss with customer orders unfulfilled. 39 client locations without product access. Competitor opportunity during our market absence. Customer loyalty permanently at risk.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: Emergency production allocation for KETCHUP 78 OZ - highest demand SKU (next 12 hours)
- SHORT-TERM: Implement Panama Province expedited logistics and regional inventory balancing (next 48 hours)
- LONG-TERM: Install automated inventory alerts at 14-day, 7-day, and 3-day supply levels with escalation protocols

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Clear 60% of back-orders within 72 hours. Restore KETCHUP inventory to 45-day supply within 1 week. Reduce regional concentration to <30% maximum.`;

**COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:**
- Current State: Three major XTRA locations performing at 17-24% vs industry standard 75%+ for established chain partnerships
- How We Got Here: Back-order crisis prevented fulfillment across all XTRA locations. Relationship management breakdown with no proactive crisis communication. Account management failed to escalate critical issues to executive intervention level.
- What It Should Be: Healthy chain partnerships maintain 75-85% achievement consistently. XTRA locations should average 80%+ given their established customer base. Variance should never exceed -$10K per location monthly.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
- Primary: Systematic supply failure creating fulfillment impossibility across entire chain network
- Secondary: Account management protocol breakdown - no crisis escalation or executive intervention triggered
- External: XTRA management likely evaluating alternative suppliers given our unreliable performance
- Internal: No VIP client protection protocols during operational crises

**IMPACT:** Combined -$54,537.70 variance threatens immediate partnership termination. Loss of XTRA removes major distribution channel (39 locations). Reputation damage affecting negotiations with other chains. Sales team credibility permanently damaged.

**ACTIONS:**
- IMMEDIATE: CEO-level emergency meeting with XTRA executive team within 24 hours - prevent contract cancellation
- SHORT-TERM: Deploy dedicated XTRA account manager with daily performance reporting and communication protocols (next 7 days)
- LONG-TERM: Establish VIP client protection system with guaranteed supply commitments and executive escalation triggers for top 3 chains

**SUCCESS METRICS:** Recover XTRA average performance to 65%+ within 30 days. Reduce combined variance to -$20,000 maximum. Secure written partnership extension despite current crisis.`;
