**Why this matters:**
- Internal Sales Data: These represent our three biggest product losses this year
- Inventory System: ADOBO PARA TODO has zero movement indicating complete market rejection
- Financial Impact: Combined losses exceed $500 in direct revenue per SKU

**What to do:**
- Discontinue ADOBO PARA TODO 175 GRS immediately to stop inventory bleeding
- Investigate ANIS ESTRELLA supply chain issues - potential quality or pricing problem
- Reassign shelf space from failing SKUs to high-performing products like PRODUCTOS ALIMENTICIOS SPACIAL`;

**Why this matters:**
- Internal Financial Data: This is our worst monthly performance on record
- Cash Flow Risk: 81% revenue drop threatens operational liquidity
- Margin Compression: Margin crashed to 0.66 vs normal 2.6 range

**What to do:**
- Activate emergency cash flow management protocols
- Focus sales team on high-margin, fast-moving SKUs
- Implement immediate cost reduction measures in production and operations`;

**Why this matters:**
- Internal Sales Data: 86% below target indicates systemic sales execution failure
- Chain Performance: XTRA locations showing consistent underperformance pattern
- Market Share Risk: Only PRODUCTOS ALIMENTICIOS SPACIAL performing well (95.96%)

**What to do:**
- Deploy immediate sales intervention team to all XTRA locations
- Analyze PRODUCTOS ALIMENTICIOS SPACIAL success factors for replication
- Implement daily performance tracking and corrective action protocols`;

**Why this matters:**
- Internal Production Data: Only delivered $564.71 vs expected production schedule
- Geographic Risk: Panama Province concentration creates supply chain vulnerability
- Customer Impact: Key SKUs unavailable during peak demand period

**What to do:**
- Prioritize KETCHUP 78 OZ production immediately - highest demand SKU
- Establish emergency supply protocol for Panama Province distribution
- Implement back-order early warning system to prevent future stockouts`;

**Why this matters:**
- Internal CRM Data: XTRA chain systematic underperformance across all locations
- Financial Impact: Combined negative variance exceeds $54,000
- Relationship Risk: Back-order issues affecting 39 locations threatens partnership

**What to do:**
- Schedule immediate executive meeting with XTRA chain management
- Deploy dedicated account manager to resolve back-order issues
- Implement performance improvement plan with weekly review checkpoints`;

**Why this matters:**
- Internal Performance Data: Multiple systems showing red flags simultaneously
- Financial Risk: Revenue and margin compression threaten business sustainability
- Market Position: Competitive disadvantage developing across key channels

**What to do:**
- Activate crisis management protocols across all departments
- Focus resources on PRODUCTOS ALIMENTICIOS SPACIAL success model
