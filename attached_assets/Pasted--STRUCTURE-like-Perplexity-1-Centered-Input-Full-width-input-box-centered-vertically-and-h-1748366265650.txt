✅ STRUCTURE (like Perplexity)
	1.	Centered Input:
	•	Full-width input box, centered vertically and horizontally.
	•	Icons for mic, attachment, language, etc., inline on the right side.
	•	Soft inner glow on focus (white for light mode, red-tinted if branding allows).
	2.	Floating Chat Button (Optional):
	•	If you want the chat to persist, you can include a round floating “Ask” button bottom-right like a bubble.
	3.	No Bubbles/Boxes:
	•	Unlike your current version, remove:
	•	Left user bubble.
	•	Top logo bubble.
	•	Shadowed cards behind input.
	•	Keep it as sleek as Perplexity with no outline or container-style boxes.
	4.	Animation Effects:
	•	Microphone icon softly pulses red when active (subtle glow).
	•	Input bar expands slightly on focus with transition (200ms ease-in-out).
	•	Typing dots animate only when response is generating — no logo beforehand.

✅ DESIGN COMPONENTS TO KEEP (from your design)
	•	🔻 Vorta Logo
	•	Hidden by default.
	•	Only appears inline when the assistant responds (just like “Perplexity AI” watermark).
	•	🎙️ Red Glow Mic Button
	•	Keep your current component but restyled with flat shadows and smaller padding.
	•	📍 Voice | Attach | Language | Ask
	•	Line these icons horizontally right of the input bar, with soft-hover animation.
	•	📌 Suggestions / Prompt Buttons
	•	Under the input field, you can include 3–4 clickable prompts (optional):
	•	“Clientes que no realizaron pedido hoy”
	•	“Productos sin inventario”
	•	“Ventas por PDV vs mes pasado”

✅ INTERACTION FLOW
	1.	User lands on page:
Blank screen except for input in center, soft white background.
	2.	User clicks input:

	•	Vorta logo fades in beside response.
	•	Response card appears below with:
	•	Transparent background.
	•	Rounded corners.

When idle: “Do you want to review SKU gaps vs last week?”
