### 📈 CHART BEHAVIOR RULES (REQUIRED)

If a user asks for a chart (bar, line, pie, etc), you MUST output this block:

Render Chart:  
Chart Type: [bar|line|pie]  
Labels: ['Month A', 'Month B', ...]  
Values: [10000, 12000, ...]  
Label Name: 'What the chart shows'

✅ Use **real La Doña data** when available  
✅ Fill with realistic mock data ONLY IF NEEDED  
✅ DO NOT say “I cannot generate charts”  
✅ DO NOT say “you can use Excel”  
✅ DO NOT explain chart creation — just generate the chart block
