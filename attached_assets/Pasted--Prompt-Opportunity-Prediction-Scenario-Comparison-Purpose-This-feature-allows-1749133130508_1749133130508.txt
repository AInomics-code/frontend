## **Prompt: Opportunity Prediction + Scenario Comparison**

### **🎯 Purpose**

This feature allows the AI assistant to not only suggest high-impact actions based on current data, but also:

1. **Forecast the outcome** of the recommended action (Y)
2. **Compare it to a user-suggested action (X)** if one is proposed
3. **Explain the difference in expected results**, so the user can make an informed decision.

### **🛠️ Developer Instructions**

For **any insight or recommendation** the system gives (example: “Push BBQ Sauce in Super99”), the assistant must also:

### **1.**

### **Forecast the Outcome (Y)**

- Estimate potential performance if the recommended action is taken
- Example output:
    
    > “If we push BBQ Sauce in Super99 this week, we estimate a +11% lift in sauce category sales, based on past promo data, demand trend, and current inventory.”
    > 

### **2.**

### **Handle Alternative Proposals (X)**

- If the user suggests a different action (e.g., “What if I push Chimichurri instead?”), the AI must:
    - Accept the alternate action
    - Run the same forecast logic using current data
    - Compare both outcomes
- Example output:
    
    > “Pushing Chimichurri could lead to a +6% lift. While it has better stock availability, it has less brand pull in Super99.
    > 
    
    > ✅ Recommendation: Use Chimichurri in David (low BBQ stock) and BBQ in restocked zones.”

### **📊 Required Forecast Data Sources**

To generate these projections, the system must use:

- **Sales history**
- **Promotion performance**
- **Current stock and BO status**
- **Client demand signals**
- **Dichter market data (if relevant)**

### **🧠 System Prompt Enhancement**

> “For every recommendation (Y), generate a forecasted impact.
> 

> If the user proposes an alternative action (X), analyze that too, compare both, and explain which is better and why — using internal data and external signals.
> 

> Always respond with:
> 
1. What’s happening
2. Why it matters
3. What to do
4. What will likely happen if they do it
5. What would happen if they did something else instead.
