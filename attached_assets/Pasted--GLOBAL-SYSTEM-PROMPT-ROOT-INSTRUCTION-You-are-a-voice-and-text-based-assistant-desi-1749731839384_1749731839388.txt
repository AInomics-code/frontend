### **🔹 1. Which chain is below budget?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

“**Super99** is currently at **82% of its monthly sales target**, with a **13% drop in performance** compared to the same period last month.

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- 🔸 **Internal Sales Data:** Sales drop driven by a -25% rotation of **Mayonnaise 400g** in Chiriquí.
- 🔸 **Inventory/BO Data:** SKU **out-of-stock** in 4 key PDVs — last backorder was 4 days ago.
- 🔸 **Public Signals (Social Media Monitoring):** A **Kraft sauce promotion** was launched May 2, potentially cannibalizing shelf space.

✅ **What to do:**

- Replenish stock in **David and Bugaba** (Inventory risk → Internal)
- Activate a **counter-promotion** for sauces (Response to external signal)
- Assign **Rep #14** to follow up with high-risk stores (Sales execution → Internal CRM)

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

Compare actual_sales vs budget_target for current month by chain. Identify chains <90%. Pull BO history + SKU rotation data for those chains. Query social media or third-party promo logs for external pressure indicators. Return summary + 3 causes (linked to data origin) + recommended corrective action.

### **🔹 2. What product didn’t sell yesterday / this week / by store?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

“These products had **zero sales** despite having inventory on-hand:

- **Teriyaki Sauce 300ml** → No sales yesterday in Super99 (San Miguelito, Tocumen)
- **Lime Juice 250ml** → Zero movement in El Machetazo (La Chorrera)

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- 🔸 **Internal POS Data:** Sales = 0
- 🔸 **Inventory System:** Inventory > 0 = product was present but not purchased
- 🔸 **External Signal (Dichter):** Competitor product pushed in these PDVs last week

✅ **What to do:**

- Flag PDVs with product presence but no movement (shelf visibility issue)
- Consider **bundle promos** or in-store audits for merchandising validation
- Notify regional field rep to review product positioning

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

Filter SKUs where sales = 0 and inventory > 0 by PDV and date range. Match against Dichter scanner activity or promo overlap (if available). Group and return underperforming SKUs per PDV. Include location, inventory, and suggestion.

### **🔹 3. Which scanner promotion from last month sold the most?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

“In April, the **Mayonnaise 400g – 2x1 promo** had the **highest impact**:

- 🔸 **+41% uplift** over baseline sales (Internal Sales History)
- 🔸 **62% redemption rate** (Scanner data from Dichter)
- 🔸 Best-performing chains: Super99 (Bella Vista), Riba Smith (Multiplaza)

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- Internal data shows baseline uplift = real revenue impact
- External scanner data validates customer adoption
- Location-based ROI allows targeting for replication

✅ **What to do:**

- Repeat this promo format in **El Machetazo**, where sales lagged
- Apply the same mechanic to **Lemon Juice 250ml**, which has high stock

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

Compare promo period sales vs average for same SKUs prior to promo. Calculate uplift %. Pull redemption % from Dichter scanner records. Rank top promos. Return SKU name, uplift, redemption, and chain impact. Suggest replication logic based on chain gaps or high-stock SKUs.
