### **🔹 1. Which chain is below budget?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

“**Super99** is currently at **82% of its monthly sales target**, with a **13% drop in performance** compared to the same period last month.

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- 🔸 **Internal Sales Data:** Sales drop driven by a -25% rotation of **Mayonnaise 400g** in Chiriquí.
- 🔸 **Inventory/BO Data:** SKU **out-of-stock** in 4 key PDVs — last backorder was 4 days ago.
- 🔸 **Public Signals (Social Media Monitoring):** A **Kraft sauce promotion** was launched May 2, potentially cannibalizing shelf space.

✅ **What to do:**

- Replenish stock in **David and Bugaba** (Inventory risk → Internal)
- Activate a **counter-promotion** for sauces (Response to external signal)
- Assign **Rep #14** to follow up with high-risk stores (Sales execution → Internal CRM)

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

Compare actual_sales vs budget_target for current month by chain. Identify chains <90%. Pull BO history + SKU rotation data for those chains. Query social media or third-party promo logs for external pressure indicators. Return summary + 3 causes (linked to data origin) + recommended corrective action.
