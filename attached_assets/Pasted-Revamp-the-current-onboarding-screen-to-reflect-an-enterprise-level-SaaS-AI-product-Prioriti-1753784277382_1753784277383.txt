Revamp the current `/onboarding` screen to reflect an **enterprise-level SaaS AI product**. Prioritize premium aesthetics, high UX standards, and modern UI behavior.

🎯 Theme:
- Revert back to the **original color gradient** used in login/sign-up (deep blue → neon cyan blend)
- Maintain **glassmorphic card containers** with very subtle transparency
- Clean vertical rhythm and consistent grid spacing (24px padding minimum)

🧠 Title:
- Move to **top-left** beside VORTA logo icon
- Line 1: `Let's get you set up`
- Line 2 (subtext): `Choose how to connect your business data below. You can skip and configure this later.`
- Font: semi-bold, slightly tighter letter-spacing, size ~30–36px, not overblown
- Animate the header in from the left using `framer-motion`

🧩 System Connect Cards:
- Replace big blocks with **compact, interactive glass tiles**
- Use 3-column responsive grid (auto-stack on mobile)
- Icons must be smaller (22–26px max), outlined or line-style (not bulky filled)
- On hover:
  - Slight glow + scale (1.02x)
  - Button turns into "Connect" CTA
- On click:
  - Expand into input field with sliding animation (`motion.div`)
  - Use `mysql://`, `apikey:`, or file upload as placeholders

💻 Sources to include:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Google Sheets
- Airtable
- Excel/CSV
- REST API

✅ UX Details:
- Cards should **not feel like buttons**, they should feel like **selectable modules**
- Add subtle drop shadow + depth like Defog.ai's dashboard layout
- Use modern icon library (`lucide-react` recommended for thin icons)
- Small pill-tag underneath label showing `Not connected` or `Connected`

🔘 Bottom CTAs:
- Left: “Skip setup” — minimal text-button with opacity 70%
- Right: “Connect & Continue →” — premium button with a **dark gradient base**, slight glow when hovered, not the playful light blue. Text centered.

🎬 Page Transitions:
- As soon as sign-up completes, use a **slide-and-fade** animation to route here
- Use `AnimatePresence` and `motion.section` for a complete unmount and enter animation
- Animate the cards’ appearance with staggered delays (100ms each)

🧪 Microinteractions:
- As user connects a source, card should “pulse” once subtly
- Replace “Not connected” label with a green dot + “Connected”
- If user tries to continue without selecting anything, a micro-toast warns: “You’ll be able to connect sources later from your dashboard.”

🛠 Stack:
- React (Vite or CRA)
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- Optional: Zustand for temp state mgmt.

🪄 Goal:
This must look like a **cross between Defog.ai’s onboarding and Microsoft Copilot Studio**, but with VORTA’s visual identity: sharp, minimal, premium, tech-first.

Deliver a production-grade interface with perfect alignment, consistent spacing, and interactive polish.

Do **not reuse the old cards or layout** — design it from scratch using these specs.
