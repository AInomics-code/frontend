### **Sales Analyst – Workflow & Thinking Model**

---

## **🕘 Start of Day (8:00–9:30 AM)**

**Goal:** Gain a clear view of current sales performance and identify any red flags.

1. **Open sales dashboards by chain and channel**
    - Key metric: *Sales vs Budget*
    - Drill down: monthly → weekly → daily
2. **Check for underperforming chains**
    - Compare current results vs prior periods
    - Focus on % to target and trend drops
3. **Flag chains with anomalies**
    - If a chain is <90% of target → investigate causes
    - Action: mark for follow-up / notify sales team

---

## **🧾 Midday (9:30–12:00 PM)**

**Goal:** Diagnose the causes behind performance gaps and prepare alerts or recommendations for commercial leadership.

1. **Cross-check performance with other data sources**
    - Are there out-of-stock issues? (Data: BO / Inventory)
    - Has SKU rotation dropped? (Data: Rotation history)
    - Is a competitor running a promo? (Data: Social / Dichter)
2. **Build reports for management**
    - Highlight actionable insights
    - Explain the cause + recommended response
3. **Alert chain managers or sales reps**
    - Via WhatsApp or email
    - With action-oriented messages:
        
        *“Salsa 500g out of stock in Super99 David. Kraft promo active. Can you confirm restock today?”*

## **📊 Afternoon (1:30–4:00 PM)**

**Goal:** Spot growth opportunities, support campaign planning, and optimize execution.

1. **Identify slow-moving SKUs with high inventory**
    - Cross-reference warehouse, store, and product data
    - Prioritize high-margin products
2. **Spot activatable opportunities**
    - Which products are trending up and could be scaled?
    - Which chains have low penetration but high potential?
3. **Suggest bundles, visibility plays, or promos**
    - Based on past results and seasonal context
    - Prepares a proposal for sales or marketing teams
