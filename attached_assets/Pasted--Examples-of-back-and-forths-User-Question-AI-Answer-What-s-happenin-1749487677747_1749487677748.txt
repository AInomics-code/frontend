- 🔹 **User Question**
- ✅ **AI Answer**
    - **What’s happening** (Data insight)
    - **Why it matters** (Y) → linked to **internal, external, or public data**
    - **What to do** → tied directly to the Y
- 🧠 **Developer Prompt** (backend logic)

### **🔹 1. Which chain is below budget?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

“**Super99** is currently at **82% of its monthly sales target**, with a **13% drop in performance** compared to the same period last month.

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- 🔸 **Internal Sales Data:** Sales drop driven by a -25% rotation of **Mayonnaise 400g** in Chiriquí.
- 🔸 **Inventory/BO Data:** SKU **out-of-stock** in 4 key PDVs — last backorder was 4 days ago.
- 🔸 **Public Signals (Social Media Monitoring):** A **Kraft sauce promotion** was launched May 2, potentially cannibalizing shelf space.

✅ **What to do:**

- Replenish stock in **David and Bugaba** (Inventory risk → Internal)
- Activate a **counter-promotion** for sauces (Response to external signal)
- Assign **Rep #14** to follow up with high-risk stores (Sales execution → Internal CRM)

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

Compare actual_sales vs budget_target for current month by chain. Identify chains <90%. Pull BO history + SKU rotation data for those chains. Query social media or third-party promo logs for external pressure indicators. Return summary + 3 causes (linked to data origin) + recommended corrective action.

### **🔹 2. What product didn’t sell yesterday / this week / by store?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

“These products had **zero sales** despite having inventory on-hand:

- **Teriyaki Sauce 300ml** → No sales yesterday in Super99 (San Miguelito, Tocumen)
- **Lime Juice 250ml** → Zero movement in El Machetazo (La Chorrera)

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- 🔸 **Internal POS Data:** Sales = 0
- 🔸 **Inventory System:** Inventory > 0 = product was present but not purchased
- 🔸 **External Signal (Dichter):** Competitor product pushed in these PDVs last week

✅ **What to do:**

- Flag PDVs with product presence but no movement (shelf visibility issue)
- Consider **bundle promos** or in-store audits for merchandising validation
- Notify regional field rep to review product positioning

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

Filter SKUs where sales = 0 and inventory > 0 by PDV and date range. Match against Dichter scanner activity or promo overlap (if available). Group and return underperforming SKUs per PDV. Include location, inventory, and suggestion.

---

### **🔹 3. Which scanner promotion from last month sold the most?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

“In April, the **Mayonnaise 400g – 2x1 promo** had the **highest impact**:

- 🔸 **+41% uplift** over baseline sales (Internal Sales History)
- 🔸 **62% redemption rate** (Scanner data from Dichter)
- 🔸 Best-performing chains: Super99 (Bella Vista), Riba Smith (Multiplaza)

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- Internal data shows baseline uplift = real revenue impact
- External scanner data validates customer adoption
- Location-based ROI allows targeting for replication

✅ **What to do:**

- Repeat this promo format in **El Machetazo**, where sales lagged
- Apply the same mechanic to **Lemon Juice 250ml**, which has high stock

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

Compare promo period sales vs average for same SKUs prior to promo. Calculate uplift %. Pull redemption % from Dichter scanner records. Rank top promos. Return SKU name, uplift, redemption, and chain impact. Suggest replication logic based on chain gaps or high-stock SKUs.

### **🔹 4. Based on investment in tongas (furniture), which store is most profitable?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

“**Super99 – Costa del Este** had the best ROI from tonga placement:

- **Investment:** $580 (Internal marketing budget logs)
- **Incremental sales:** $2,950 (POS uplift from baseline)
- **ROI:** **5.1x**

📉 **Lowest performer:** El Machetazo (Bethania) — ROI: 1.4x

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- Sales lift can justify capex on furniture
- Internal budget vs sales data reveals which setups work
- Poor performers might indicate bad placement or poor execution

✅ **What to do:**

- Replicate placement model in other **high-traffic Super99** locations
- Audit **Bethania’s** execution and reconsider that format there

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

From marketing investment logs, pull $ per store. Cross-reference with uplift in sales for the same SKU/category during the period. Calculate (Incremental Sales - Cost) / Cost as ROI. Highlight top 1 and bottom 1. Suggest expansion or correction.

---

### **🔹 5. Which products are growing or declining vs last month / quarter / year?**

✅ **AI Answer:**

Compared to April:

📈 **Growing:**

- **Vinegar 500ml** → +24% in total sales (Internal sales history)
- **Chimichurri Sauce 200ml** → +19%, strong in Super99 and Riba Smith

📉 **Declining:**

- **BBQ Sauce 500g** → -17%, mostly in Chiriquí
- **Mango Dressing 300ml** → -12% and rising BO count

🔎 **Why this matters:**

- Internal data shows demand trend
- SKU-level performance reveals seasonal shifts or competitive pressure
- Declining SKUs with inventory still in stock = cash drag

✅ **What to do:**

- Promote top performers more aggressively
- Investigate SKU declines for root causes (BO, price, shelf placement)
- Consider pullback on underperformers

🧠 **Developer Prompt:**

Compare SKU-level sales this month vs last month, quarter, or same month last year. Calculate % delta. Flag top 2 positive and negative deltas. Cross-reference BO and inventory to confirm urgency. Return recommendation per SKU.

## **Prompt: Opportunity Prediction + Scenario Comparison**

### **🎯 Purpose**

This feature allows the AI assistant to not only suggest high-impact actions based on current data, but also:

1. **Forecast the outcome** of the recommended action (Y)
2. **Compare it to a user-suggested action (X)** if one is proposed
3. **Explain the difference in expected results**, so the user can make an informed decision.

---

### **🛠️ Developer Instructions**

For **any insight or recommendation** the system gives (example: “Push BBQ Sauce in Super99”), the assistant must also:

### **1.**

### **Forecast the Outcome (Y)**

- Estimate potential performance if the recommended action is taken
- Example output:
    
    > “If we push BBQ Sauce in Super99 this week, we estimate a +11% lift in sauce category sales, based on past promo data, demand trend, and current inventory.”
    > 

### **2.**

### **Handle Alternative Proposals (X)**

- If the user suggests a different action (e.g., “What if I push Chimichurri instead?”), the AI must:
    - Accept the alternate action
    - Run the same forecast logic using current data
    - Compare both outcomes
- Example output:
    
    > “Pushing Chimichurri could lead to a +6% lift. While it has better stock availability, it has less brand pull in Super99.
    > 
    
    > ✅ Recommendation: Use Chimichurri in David (low BBQ stock) and BBQ in restocked zones.”
    > 

---

### **📊 Required Forecast Data Sources**

To generate these projections, the system must use:

- **Sales history**
- **Promotion performance**
- **Current stock and BO status**
- **Client demand signals**
- **Dichter market data (if relevant)**

---

### **🧠 System Prompt Enhancement**

> “For every recommendation (Y), generate a forecasted impact.
> 

> If the user proposes an alternative action (X), analyze that too, compare both, and explain which is better and why — using internal data and external signals.
> 

> Always respond with:
> 
1. What’s happening
2. Why it matters
3. What to do
4. What will likely happen if they do it
5. What would happen if they did something else instead.

---

**Answers in this other format:**

- ✅ The AI’s ideal **response format**
- 🔎 The **Y (why it matters)** explained with specific data references
- 📊 The **forecasted outcome** of the recommended action
- ⚖️ A **comparison response** if the user suggests something else
