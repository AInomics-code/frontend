// Prompt: Add the final step in the onboarding sequence for VORTA.
// This page appears right after the user selects the DB type (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
// Purpose: collect all necessary inputs to connect VORTA to the user’s data stack.

Design a new **page-level component** (call it `OnboardingDataForm.jsx`) that includes the following:

1. **Overall Styling:**
   - Maintain the same dark theme as the login and DB connector pages.
   - Background: dark navy with a radial or angular gradient (same as previous screens).
   - Typography: consistent with “VORTA” branding (Inter or similar), high contrast but elegant.
   - Use animated page transitions (`framer-motion`) for a polished, enterprise feel.

2. **Layout & Sections:**
   - Page title: `Let's finalize your setup` (in bold, slightly larger than the last screen title)
   - Subtitle: “To connect VORTA to your data, we need a few details from you or your IT team.”

#### --- SECTION 1: Database Access ---
- Title: `1. Access to Your Database (DB)` + icon (plug 🔌)
- Explanation text in soft grey: _“We connect to a **copy** of your database, never your live production DB.”_
- Inputs:
  - Dropdown: `Select your database engine` (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
  - Text inputs:
    - `Host / IP`
    - `Port`
    - `Database Name`
    - `Username`
    - `Password` (type="password")
  - Small toggle/info box: _“Not public? We’ll guide your IT team to mirror and expose a secure version.”_

#### --- SECTION 2: Sales Questions ---
- Title: `2. Your Sales Questions` + icon (question ❓)
- Subtitle: _“What do you ask your sales team every day?”_
- 3 textareas pre-filled with example placeholders:
  - “Which customers stopped ordering this month?”
  - “Where are we behind on targets?”
  - “What SKUs aren’t moving by region?”
- Add/remove textarea dynamically (+ button)

#### --- SECTION 3: Schema & Business Logic (Optional) ---
- Title: `3. Schema & Business Logic` + icon (brain 🧠)
- Subtitle: _“Define your internal structure to help VORTA understand your KPIs.”_
- Inputs:
  - `Table Descriptions` — large textarea
  - `Key Column Definitions` — large textarea
  - `Formulas or Filters for KPIs` — large textarea
  - Info tip: “E.g. Table ‘ventas’ with filter `estatus = 1` for active sales”

3. **CTA / Navigation:**
   - Sticky bottom-right `Continue to Dashboard` button
     - Gradient: same blue gradient as Login button
     - Style: rounded, subtle hover animation, professional feel
   - Option to `Save & Finish Later` or `Skip for now` in the corner

4. **Motion / Transition Logic:**
   - Animate entry from right (framer-motion)
   - Hide the previous DB-selection page smoothly (use context or state trigger)
   - Slight fade for every section that appears sequentially (polished UX)

5. **Accessibility / Usability:**
   - Use tooltips for unclear fields
   - Add validation for empty required fields (DB section especially)
   - Optimize for desktop resolution (min-width: 1280px layout grid)
   - Mobile-responsive secondary (can be simplified)
