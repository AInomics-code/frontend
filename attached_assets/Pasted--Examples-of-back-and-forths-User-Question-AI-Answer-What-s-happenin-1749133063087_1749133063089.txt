### **ðŸ”¹ 1. Which chain is below budget?**

â€œ**Super99** is currently at **82% of its monthly sales target**, with a **13% drop in performance** compared to the same period last month.

ðŸ”Ž **Why this matters:**

- ðŸ”¸ **Public Signals (Social Media Monitoring):** A **Kraft sauce promotion** was launched May 2, potentially cannibalizing shelf space.

âœ… **What to do:**

- Replenish stock in **David and Bugaba** (Inventory risk â†’ Internal)
- Activate a **counter-promotion** for sauces (Response to external signal)
- Assign **Rep #14** to follow up with high-risk stores (Sales execution â†’ Internal CRM)
