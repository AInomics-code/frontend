Update the current onboarding screen to match the visual quality and UX smoothness of the previous login/signup views, with a more refined, enterprise SaaS aesthetic inspired by Microsoft Copilot Studio.

🎨 VISUAL POLISH:

1. **Background & Theme**
   - Restore the same gradient theme used in the login/signup pages (deep navy to blue-violet gradient).
   - Make sure the background color flows seamlessly across the full viewport, no harsh edges.

2. **VORTA Icon (Top-Left)**
   - Increase size by ~20% (but still aligned to the text baseline of the header).
   - Add a soft glow or floating animation on hover for elegance.

3. **Header Area**
   - Title: `Let's get you set up` – keep on the left, but match the size and spacing with login header.
   - Font weight: medium to semi-bold (not too heavy), letter-spacing -0.5px
   - Subtitle: subtle grey (`text-slate-400`) smaller font (~15px), below title, max width ~70%

🧱 CONNECTION CARDS

4. **Card Structure:**
   - Increase corner radius slightly (to match login input fields).
   - Add consistent padding inside cards (top/bottom: 18px, left/right: 24px)
   - Background color: use a semi-transparent dark-blue with a soft blur (glassmorphism)
   - Add subtle box-shadow (`shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]`) for floating depth
   - When hovered: slight scale-up (`scale-105`) and outline highlight using Tailwind `ring` utilities

5. **Icons Inside Cards:**
   - Increase each icon size by ~15–20%
   - Maintain vector smoothness (use `lucide-react` or similar clean icons)
   - Left-aligned within card, beside text
   - Label text: use `font-medium`, keep spacing tight (no extra margins)

6. **Status Tag:**
   - Use dot + “Not connected” inline
   - Dot: Tailwind `bg-slate-400 h-2 w-2 rounded-full`
   - Replace with green dot + “Connected” on success

🧭 USER FLOW CONTROLS:

7. **Footer CTA Buttons:**
   - Left: “Skip for now” – smaller, secondary text button, subtle opacity (60%)
   - Right: “Connect & Continue →” – full-width button with deep navy base and bright cyan edge glow
   - Add framer-motion animation on hover (slight movement and glow effect)

🧩 MICRO UX DETAILS:

8. **Card Expand Interaction:**
   - On click, card expands downward to reveal config field (`motion.div`)
   - For REST API, show a text input: “Paste API Key…”
   - For PostgreSQL/MySQL: “Enter DB URI…”
   - For Excel: enable file upload button with drop zone

9. **Transitions:**
   - Use `framer-motion` to animate this screen into view from right, fading in
   - Cards appear with staggered animation (50–100ms delay each)

📐 RESPONSIVENESS:
   - Cards stack into 1-column on mobile (<768px)
   - Header and buttons center-align on mobile

🔁 Inspiration:
   - Follow structure + elegance of Microsoft Copilot setup screen
   - Keep VORTA's look feeling premium, lean, and quietly powerful — **not flashy, not playful**

🎯 FINAL GOAL:
Make the onboarding screen feel like part of a modern SaaS onboarding wizard — the user should feel like they're connecting a serious business system. Maintain **calm colors, readable type, subtle depth, and clean layout**.
