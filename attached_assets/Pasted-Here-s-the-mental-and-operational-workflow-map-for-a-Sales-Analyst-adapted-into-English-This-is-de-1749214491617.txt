Here’s the mental and operational workflow map for a Sales Analyst, adapted into English. This is designed to help the AI assistant not just answer questions, but understand the context, priorities, and logic behind each decision — making it feel like part of the team.

🧠 Sales Analyst – Workflow & Thinking Model

⸻

🕘 Start of Day (8:00–9:30 AM)

Goal: Gain a clear view of current sales performance and identify any red flags.
	1.	Open sales dashboards by chain and channel
	•	Key metric: Sales vs Budget
	•	Drill down: monthly → weekly → daily
	2.	Check for underperforming chains
	•	Compare current results vs prior periods
	•	Focus on % to target and trend drops
	3.	Flag chains with anomalies
	•	If a chain is <90% of target → investigate causes
	•	Action: mark for follow-up / notify sales team

⸻

🧾 Midday (9:30–12:00 PM)

Goal: Diagnose the causes behind performance gaps and prepare alerts or recommendations for commercial leadership.
	1.	Cross-check performance with other data sources
	•	Are there out-of-stock issues? (Data: BO / Inventory)
	•	Has SKU rotation dropped? (Data: Rotation history)
	•	Is a competitor running a promo? (Data: Social / Dichter)
	2.	Build reports for management
	•	Highlight actionable insights
	•	Explain the cause + recommended response
	3.	Alert chain managers or sales reps
	•	Via WhatsApp or email
	•	With action-oriented messages:
“Salsa 500g out of stock in Super99 David. Kraft promo active. Can you confirm restock today?”

⸻

📊 Afternoon (1:30–4:00 PM)

Goal: Spot growth opportunities, support campaign planning, and optimize execution.
	1.	Identify slow-moving SKUs with high inventory
	•	Cross-reference warehouse, store, and product data
	•	Prioritize high-margin products
	2.	Spot activatable opportunities
	•	Which products are trending up and could be scaled?
	•	Which chains have low penetration but high potential?
	3.	Suggest bundles, visibility plays, or promos
	•	Based on past results and seasonal context
	•	Prepares a proposal for sales or marketing teams

This mental model should be translated into a conversational AI flow that mirrors this thinking pattern — so the AI can respond, predict, and assist like a trained analyst without needing constant explanation.
